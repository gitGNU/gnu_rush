Version 1.1, 2008-08-30

* A condition can be negated.

Placing ! between the keyword and expression of a condition indicates
its negation, e.g.:

  command ! ^cvs

matches any command line that does not begin with `cvs'  

* New action `exit'

The `exit' statement insructs rush to write the supplied error message
to the specified file descriptor and exit immediately.  If file
descriptor is not given, 2 (standard error) is used.

Exit actions are useful for writing ``trap rules'', i.e. rules that
are intended to trap incorrect or prohibited command lines and to return
customized reply messages in such cases. 

* New statement `regexp'

Configures the style of regular expressions used in subsequent
`cmdline' and `match' clauses.  For example:

  regex +icase +extended

sets case-insensitive extended regular expressions.
